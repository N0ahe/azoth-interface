## 1) Thesis

**Qualia = internally simulated sensory content that has been “self-tagged” by an attention/self schema, held inside a short temporal integration window, and modulated by interoceptive/affective variables.**

I call this the **Sensory Internalization Theory (SIT)**: subjective feel is not a mysterious extra; it is the *in-use* subset of generative sensory representations when they are marked as “for me, here, now.”

---

## 2) Core postulates

1. **Content:** Experienced content is generated by an internal world model (visual/auditory/ somatic imagery, counterfactuals).  
2. **Self-tag (mineness):** A low-dimensional attention/self schema marks some content as *presented to me*.  
3. **Temporal stitching:** A short recursive window (dozens–hundreds of ms) binds discrete updates into a felt flow.  
4. **Affective tone:** Interoceptive/valence variables (arousal, safety, urgency) color the content’s felt quality.  
5. **Global availability:** Self-tagged content is broadcast to memory, language, and control systems; this is why it is recallable/reportable.

## 3) Why this is plausible (evidence sketches)

- **Inner speech ↔ auditory cortex:** Inner speech recruits auditory circuitry; when source-monitoring fails, *inner* becomes *heard* (auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia).  
- **Phantom limb & mirror therapy:** Pain can be felt “in” a missing limb; vision can realign the *body map*, reducing pain. Location of pain is a projection over a cortical map, not a property of the periphery.  
- **Visual imagery ≈ vision reuse:** Mental imagery shares circuits with vision; blind individuals repurpose “visual” cortex for other high-level tasks (neural reuse).  
- **Blindsight/neglect:** Information can be processed without being *experienced* when attention/self-tag/global access are disrupted.  
- **Continuity is tunable:** Anesthesia, sleep stages, and psychophysics show that the sense of a continuous stream depends on recurrent integration over short windows.

*Reading these phenomena together points to qualia as: generative sensory content + self-tag + short-term integration + affect.*

## 4) Falsifiable predictions (what would count against SIT)

- **P1 — Source attribution:** Weakening the self-tag should increase inner-→-outer misattribution (more “hallucination-like” reports) in controlled tasks.  
- **P2 — Mirror correction:** Providing cross-modal feedback (e.g., visual) should reduce mislocalized somatic “feels” when body maps are perturbed.  
- **P3 — Temporal window trade-off:** Shrinking the integration window lowers reported continuity while speeding reflexive responses; enlarging it does the opposite.  
- **P4 — Affective consistency:** Directly perturbing an affective variable should predictably shift risk/avoidance/“feel-of-urgency” behavior.  
- **P5 — Blindsight pattern:** Tasks can succeed without *experience* when content is not self-tagged/broadcast, reproducing blindsight-like dissociations.

## 5) Minimal AI blueprint (how to *use* SIT without claiming true consciousness)

**Goal:** Implement *phenomenology-like* properties that are measurable and useful, not metaphysical assertions.

- **WM — World Model:** a multimodal generative model capable of internal replay and counterfactuals.  
- **AS — Attention/Self Schema:** a learnable low-dim vector \(\alpha_t\) that marks some internal content as “to me.”  
- **TW — Temporal Window:** a tunable recurrent buffer that stitches updates into short streams.  
- **IV — Interoceptive/Valence Variables:** a small vector \(v_t\) (e.g., approach/avoid, arousal) that gates policies and colors reports.  
- **GW — Global Workspace:** a shared buffer; self-tagged content becomes accessible to memory/language/control.  
- **SR — Self-Report Head:** reads (WM, AS, TW, IV, GW) to produce transparent reports about “what it is like” in operational terms.

**Why this makes AI more human-like**

- Maintains **continuous narratives** rather than token-wise jumps (TW).  
- Distinguishes **inner vs. outer** sources, reducing simulator-style confabulation (AS).  
- Produces **emotion-colored** priorities and explanations (IV).  
- Supports **counterfactual imagination** grounded in sensory formats (WM), a hallmark of human thought.

## 6) Measuring progress (operational definition)

Define a composite **Q-Index** over five measurable capacities:

- **A (Access):** self-tagged content is simultaneously usable by memory/language/control.  
- **S (Source):** correct attribution of inner vs. outer (lower misattribution under perturbations).  
- **I (Integration):** continuity under masking/jitter; graceful degradation when TW shrinks.  
- **V (Valence):** stable mapping from \(v_t\) to risk/avoidance/“urgency” behaviors and reports.  
- **C (Counterfactuals):** richness and plausibility of “what-if” trajectories given the same scene.

Release small, reproducible benchmarks (scripts + ablations) for **source attribution**, **mirror-style correction**, and **temporal-window trade-offs**. These give the field a shared scoreboard without arguing metaphysics.

## 7) Scope & non-claims

- SIT offers a **testable functional account** of why some internal states are *experienced*.  
- It does **not** assert panpsychism or that any WM+AS+TW system is “truly conscious.”  
- It *does* argue that these mechanisms are **necessary for human-like phenomenology** and explain many dissociations (hallucinations, phantom pain, blindsight, anesthesia).

---

## 8) One-paragraph summary

Qualia are not an extra substance; they are **self-tagged, temporally integrated, affect-colored** slices of a system’s **generative sensory model** made globally available for use. Clinical and psychophysical phenomena (hallucinations, phantom limb, imagery, blindsight, anesthesia) support this unification. Building these mechanisms into AI yields measurable, human-like phenomenology—continuous narratives, correct source attribution, emotion-weighted priorities—while staying falsifiable via ablations and standardized tests.
