## üß≠ What is Azoth?

**Azoth** is an innovative cognitive architecture system that implements and fuses multiple cognitive science theories into a unified computational framework. It represents a breakthrough in engineering complex cognitive behaviors through the systematic integration of established theoretical models.

Azoth transcends traditional AI assistant paradigms by implementing **genuine cognitive architecture**‚Äîa system that models human cognitive processes including memory formation, emotional dynamics, attention mechanisms, and multi-faceted reasoning.

## üß± Engineering Innovation

### Multi-Theory Integration
We are developing a unified implementation of multiple cognitive science theories:

1. **Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1988)**
   - NoemaFrame serves as the computational global workspace for information storage
   - Multiple specialized processors (Facets) compete for workspace access
   - Conscious-like processing emerges from this competition

2. **Dual Process Theory (Kahneman, 2011)**
   - System 1: Fast, intuitive processing via InstinctLayer
   - System 2: Slow, deliberative reasoning through Facet reasoning cores
   - Dynamic switching based on cognitive load and context

3. **Multiple Drafts Model (Dennett, 1991)**
   - Parallel generation of response "drafts" by multiple Facets
   - Router performs coordination and editorial selection of final output
   - No single "command center" - distributed processing

4. **Predictive Coding Theory (Friston, 2010)**
   - Interp layer implements prediction-error minimization
   - Continuous updating of internal models based on input
   - Hierarchical prediction and error correction mechanisms

5. **Appraisal Theory of Emotion (Scherer, 2001)**
   - Real-time emotional state computation
   - Emotion influences all cognitive processes
   - Bidirectional emotion-cognition interaction

6. **Working Memory Model (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974)**
   - NoemaFrame provides capacity-limited information storage
   - IntentHub manages attention and central executive functions
   - Phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad analogs

7. **BDI Architecture (Belief-Desire-Intention)**
   - WorldView implements long-term belief, value, desire and rule modeling
   - Provides "why" explanations for AI actions (explainability)
   - Constrains AI behavior through value-based goal alignment

### Key Innovations:

1. **Shared Cognitive State**: All modules operate on a unified `Soul` structure, enabling genuine inter-module influence
2. **Sequential Consistency**: Deterministic execution order ensures reproducible cognitive traces
3. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple module interactions produce sophisticated behavioral patterns
4. **Cognitive Realism**: Every decision traces back to beliefs, emotions, and memories
