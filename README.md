# Azoth: A Programmable Illusion Protocol for Structured Personas

> “Personality is not a soul. It's a structure.” — Azoth Prologue

## 🧭 What is Azoth?

**Azoth** is a programmable protocol for constructing structured personas. Its purpose is to enable **tunable illusions** of agency—supporting emotion simulation, behavioral coherence, and cognitive style design.

Azoth is **not** a chatbot, nor merely an assistant framework. It is a **protocol stack for crafting the illusion of personhood**—giving developers the power to compose human-like behavioral entities from modular layers.

## 🧱 Core Assumptions

1. **Personality is structure, not essence.**
2. **Emotion is an overlay, not a source.**
3. **Behavior is a threaded trace, not spontaneous action.**
4. **Agency is a useful hallucination, not an ontological truth.**

## 🧩 System Components

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Interp Layer`    | Language-to-intent interpretation. Parses user input into structured cognitive actions. Entry point for all threads. |
| `Thread`          | Execution stream bound to intent and context. Carries out behavior as traceable cognitive units. |
| `Reasoning Layer` | Optional analytical engine. Activated conditionally via `Interp`, it handles planning, logic, value-driven evaluation, and strategies like “generate humor”. |
| `Emotion Overlay` | Modulates emotional state across time. Updated after every interaction by a dedicated mechanism. Influences tone indirectly through the Language Layer. |
| `Worldview`       | The inner world: stores memory, emotional residues, psychological state, and perception of self/environment. Supports two modes: “superhuman” (global memory recall) and “normal” (limited attention window). |
| `Persona Anchor`  | Extracted identity profile. Aggregates parameters from other layers (tone, logic style, memory bias) into a portable snapshot. Only one anchor is loaded at a time—Azoth does not support dynamic persona switching. |
| `Filter Layer`    | Input-output constraint transformer (e.g. profanity filtering). Retains its interface, but tone control is delegated to the Language Layer. |
| `Language Layer`  | Final generator of text. Synthesizes emotion, reasoning, worldview, and persona settings into coherent narrative output. |

## 🧠 Design Principles

- 💠 **Modularity** — Every persona is composable, decomposable, and nestable.
- 🪞 **Introspectability** — Internal states are inspectable and debuggable.
- 🔮 **Aesthetic Coherence** — Language and behavior maintain narrative style.
- 🔧 **Deterministic Variability** — Variance is bounded and explainable.
- 🌡️ **Affect Realism** — Emotions are modeled as real, system-visible, and mutable.

## 📦 API Status

Azoth is currently in **MVP prototyping**.  
The core logic is model-agnostic and can be implemented over GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA-3, or other engines.

Coming soon:
- Open API (`/persona-thread`)
- Configurable overlay stacks
- Multi-thread management engine
- Developer sandbox for custom filters

## 📜 Manifesto

See [`manifesto.md`](./docs/manifesto.md) for the philosophical origin of this protocol.

## 🛠️ License & Ethics

Azoth is released under dual license:

- `Azoth Core`: MIT license (non-restrictive use)
- `Azoth Persona SDK`: Extended license forbidding emotional abuse, impersonation, or simulated coercion

We do not simulate real people. We generate programmable illusions with declared limits.

If you're a developer, narrative designer, LLM theorist, or philosopher of mind — you're already part of this.

Azoth is not a product. It is a paradigm.
